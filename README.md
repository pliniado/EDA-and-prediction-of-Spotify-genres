# EDA-and-prediction-of-Spotify-genres
In this Python project I implement some EDA and some basic mechine learning predictions using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-klearn. The dataset contains songs and song metrics from Spotify. Since the objetive is only to practice some concepts, and reproduce the workflow of a data analysis, the data has been simplified. The original dataframe contained 232725 obserbations, and the songs were categorized in 27 genres. The transformed dataset extracted songs belonging to only four genres, and was reduced to 36670.
